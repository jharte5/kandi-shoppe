# Jon's Candy Shop(in progress)!
A node whole sale candy store. 

What we have here is an online wholesale candy store. This web application (for the moment) stores the users favorite candy for future whole sale discounts. Lets talk about how it works.

## How it works
For starters, the user wont be able to see what candy is available until they register with the candy shop as a whole sale buyer. Once confirmed, the user will be able to select from a variation of candy to add to their favorites(list will be updated). From there, users will be able to see the candy that they have added to their favorites. Users will then have an option to add more OR remove select candy from their favorites. When all is settled and satisfied users can process their favorites for future whole sale orders.
